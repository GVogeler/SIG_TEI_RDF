# SiG Ontology aka RDF_TEI

The idea is to define all relevant usecase scenarios in which someone wants to transform a TEI document into RDF triples.
Accordingly different transform scenarios seem to be relevant for me.
Further we have to think which use scenarios are important.

From my point of view, a completely different topic is to formalize TEI as an ontology. 
So we shoulde name the SiG "RDF_TEI".


## Scenario 1: The whole TEI document is transformed

I'll have to try it out: https://github.com/ajstanley/TEI_to_RDF

Comment: I'm not sure if it makes much sense to transform a tree structure into a graph structure.

## Scenario 2: Already deep-structured elements are transformed to RDF

## Scenario 3: Certain semantic structures in a document are transformed to RDF

## Controlled Vocabularies and Linking

### Scenario 1: All references refer to extern taxonomies/vocabularies (Wikidata, GND, VIAF...etc.)

### Scenario 2: The teiHeader/structure inside the teiHeader is the authority

how can this authority can be published? reused by others?
